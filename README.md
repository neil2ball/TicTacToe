# TicTacToe By: Neil Ball, II

This is a simple one-player versus the computer c# WinForm of Noughts and Crosses.
It was my final project for COP2360, Introduction to C# Programming..

This was created using Visual Studio 2015.  Since it is WinForm, you will need a graphical user interface for gameplay.

The "AI" is quite simple, it randomly picks an open spot and puts the appropriate "X" or "O" in place.

You will win often.
